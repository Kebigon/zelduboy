# The legend of Zelduboy - Zelda clone for Arduboy

The goal of this project is to make an Arduboy action-adventure game similar to The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening.

## Graphics

As I'm not pretty good with graphics, I use resources from the Internet, and convert them to monochrome format using ImageMagick.

Please find below the resources I use which I didn't make myself.
